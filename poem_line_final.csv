206,BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,Thomas Campbell (1777-1844),1777,Historical Poems,"F Nelson and the north
																					Sing the glorious days renown
																					When to battle fierce came forth
																					All the might of Denmarks crown
																					And her arms along the deep proudly shone
																					By each gun the lighted brand
																					In a bold determined hand
																					And the prince of all the land
																					Led them on
																					
Like leviathans afloat
																					Lay their bulwarks on the brine
																					While the sign of battle flew
																					On the lofty British line
																					It was ten of April morn by the chime
																					As they drifted on their path
																					There was silence deep as death
																					And the boldest held his breath
																					For a time
																					
But the might of England flushed
																					To anticipate the scene
																					And her van the fleeter rushed
																					Oer the deadly space between
																					Hearts of oak our captain cried when each gun
																					From its adamantine lips
																					Spread a deathshade round the ships
																					Like the hurricane eclipse
																					Of the sun
																					
Again again again
																					And the havoc did not slack
																					Till a feeble cheer the Dane
																					To our cheering sent us back
																					Their shots along the deep slowly boom
																					Then ceased  and all is wail
																					As they strike the shattered sail
																					Or in conflagration pale
																					Light the gloom
																					
Out spoke the victor then
																					As he hailed them oer the wave
																					Ye are brothers ye are men
																					And we conquer but to save
																					So peace instead of death let us bring
																					But yield proud foe thy fleet
																					With the crews at Englands feet
																					And make submission meet
																					To our king
																					
Then Denmark blessed our chief
																					That he gave her wounds repose
																					And the sounds of joy and grief
																					From her people wildly rose
																					As death withdrew his shades from the day
																					While the sun looked smiling bright
																					Oer a wide and woeful sight
																					Where the fires of funeral light
																					Died away
																					
Now joy old England raise
																					For the tidings of thy might
																					By the festal cities blaze
																					Whilst the winecup shines in light
																					And yet amidst that joy and uproar
																					Let us think of them that sleep
																					Full many a fathom deep
																					By the wild and stormy steep
																					Elsinore
																					
Brave hearts to Britains pride
																					Once so faithful and so true
																					On the deck of fame that died
																					With the gallant good Riou 
																					Soft sigh the winds of heaven oer their grave
																					While the billow mournful rolls
																					And the mermaids song condoles
																					Singing glory to the souls
																					Of the brave

																					Now in this little godly calm
																					Yon voice might sing the Futures Psalm
																					The Psalm of Love with the brotherly eyes
																					Who pardons and is very wise
																					Yon voice that shouts highhoarse with ire
																					Fire

																					The homespuns anxious voices call
																					Brother art hurt and Where hit John
And Wipe this blood and Men come on
And Neighbor do but lift my head
And Who is wounded Who is dead
Seven are killed  My God my God
Seven lie dead on the village sod
Two Harringtons Parker Hadley Brown

Nay look stout Harrington not yet dead
He crooks his elbow lifts his head
																					He lies at the step of his own housedoor
																					He crawls and makes a path of gore
																					The wife from the window hath seen and rushed
																					He hath reached the step but the glood hath gushed
																					He hath crawled to the step of his own housedoor
																					But his head hath dropped he will crawl no more
																					Clasp Wife and kiss and lift the head
																					Harrington lies at his doorstep dead
																					
But O ye Six that round him lay

208,THE BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS,Thomas Dunn English (1819-1902),1819,Historical Poems,"ERE in my rude log cabin
																					Few poorer men there be
																					Among the mountain ranges
																					Of Eastern Tennessee
																					My limbs are weak and shrunken
																					White hairs upon my brow
																					My dog  lie still old fellow 
																					My sole companion now
																					Yet I when young and lusty
																					Have gone through stirring scenes
																					For I went down with Carroll
																					To fight at New Orleans
																					
You say youd like to hear me
																					The stirring story tell
																					Of those who stood the battle
																					And those who fighting fell
																					Short work to count our losses 
																					We stood and droppd the foe
																					As easily as by firelight
																					Men shoot the buck or doe
																					And while they fell by hundreds
																					Upon the bloody plain
																					Of us fourteen were wounded
																					And only eight were slain
																					
The eighth of January
																					Before the break of day
																					Our raw and hasty levies
																					Were brought into array
																					No cottonbales before us 
																					Some fool that falsehood told
																					Before us was an earthwork
																					Built from the swampy mold
																					And there we stood in silence
																					And waited with a frown
																					To greet with bloody welcome
																					The bulldogs of the Crown
																					
The heavy fog of morning
																					Still hid the plain from sight
																					When came a thread of scarlet
																					Marked faintly in the white
																					We fired a single cannon
																					And as its thunders rolld
																					The mist before us lifted
																					In many a heavy fold
																					The mist before us lifted
																					And in their bravery fine
																					Came rushing to their ruin
																					The fearless British line
																					
Then from our waiting cannons
																					Leapd forth the deadly flame
																					To meet the advancing columns
																					That swift and steady came
																					The thirtytwos of Crowley
																					And Bulchis twentyfour
																					To Spotts eighteenpounders
																					Responded with their roar
																					Sending the grapeshot deadly
																					That marked its pathway plain
																					And paved the road it traveld
																					With corpses of the slain
																					
Our rifles firmly grasping
																					And heedless of the din
																					We stood in silence waiting
																					For orders to begin
																					Our fingers on the triggers
																					Our hearts with anger stirrd
																					Grew still more fierce and eager
																					As Jacksons voice was heard
																					Stand steady  Waste no powder
																					Wait till your shots will tell
																					Today the work you finish
																					See that you do it well
																					
Their columns drawing nearer
																					We felt our patience tire
																					When came the voice of Carroll
																					Distinct and measured Fire
																					Oh then you should have markd us
																					Our volleys on them pour
																					Have heard our joyous rifles
																					Ring sharply through the roar
																					And seen their foremost columns
																					Melt hastily away
																					As snow in mountain gorges
																					Before the floods of May
																					
They soon reformd their columns
																					And mid the fatal rain
																					We never ceased to hurtle
																					Came to their work again
																					The Fortyfourth is with them
																					That first its laurels won
																					With stout old Abercrombie
																					Beneath an eastern sun
																					It rushes to the battle
																					And though within the rear
																					Its leader is a laggard
																					It shows no sign of fear
																					
It did not need its colonel
																					For soon there came instead
																					An eagleeyed commander
																					And on its march he led
																					Twas Pakenham in person
																					The leader of the field
																					I knew it by the cheering
																					That loudly round him peald
																					And by his quick sharp movement
																					We felt his heart was stirrd
																					As when at Salamanca
																					He led the fighting Third
																					
I raised my rifle quickly
																					I sighted at his breast
																					God save the gallant leader
																					And take him to his rest
																					I did not draw the trigger
																					I could not for my life
																					So calm he sat his charger
																					Amid the deadly strife
																					That in my fiercest moment
																					A prayer arose from me 
																					God save that gallant leader
																					Our foeman though he be
																					
Sir Edwards charger staggers
																					He leaps at once to ground
																					And ere the beast falls bleeding
																					Another horse is found
																					His right arm falls  tis wounded
																					He waves on high his left
																					In vain he leads the movement
																					The ranks in twain are cleft
																					The men in scarlet waver
																					Before the men in brown
																					And fly in utter panic 
																					The soldiers of the Crown
																					
I thought the work was over
																					But nearer shouts were heard
																					And came with Gibbs to head it
																					The gallant Ninetythird
																					Then Pakenham exulting
																					With proud and joyous glance
																					Cried Children of the tartan 
																					Bold Highlanders  advance
																					Advance to scales of breastworks
																					And drive them from their hold
																					And show the stanchless courage
																					That markd your sires of old
																					
His voice as yet was ringing
																					When quick as light there came
																					The roaring of a cannon
																					And earch seemed all aflame
																					Who causes thus the thunder
																					The doom of men to speak
																					It is the Baritarian
																					The fearless Dominique
																					Down through the marshalld Scotsmen
																					The step of death is heard
																					And by the fierce tornado
																					Falls half the Ninetythird
																					
The smoke passed slowly upward
																					And as it soared on high
																					I saw the brave commander
																					In dying anguish lie
																					They bear him from the battle
																					Who never fled the foe
																					Unmoved by death around them
																					His bearers softly go
																					In vain their care so gentle
																					Fades earth and all its scenes
																					The man of Salamanca
																					Lies dead at New Orleans
																					
But where were his lieutenants
																					Had they in terror fled
																					No  Keane was sorely wounded
																					And Gibbs as good as dead
																					Brave Wilkinson commanding
																					A major of brigade
																					The shatterd force to rally
																					A final effort made
																					He led it up our ramparts
																					Small glory did he gain 
																					Our captives some while others fled
																					And he himself was slain
																					
The stormers had retreated
																					The bloody work was oer
																					The feet of the invaders
																					Were seen to leave our shore
																					We rested on our rifles
																					And talkd about the fight
																					When came a sudden murmur
																					Like fire from left to right
																					We turned and saw our chieftain
																					And then good friend of mine
																					You should have heard the cheering
																					That ran along the line
																					
For well our men remembered
																					How little when they came
																					Had they but native courage
																					And trust in Jacksons name
																					How through the day he labored
																					How kept the vigils still
																					Till discipline controlled us
																					A stronger power than will
																					And how he hurled us at them
																					Within the evening hour
																					That red night in December
																					And made us feel our power
																					
In answer to our shouting
																					Fire lit his eye of gray
																					Erect but thin and pallid
																					He passed upon his bay
																					Weak from the baffled fever
																					And shrunken in each limb
																					The swamps of Alabama
																					Had done their work on him
																					But spite of that and fasting
																					And hours of sleepless care
																					The soul of Andrew Jackson
																					Shone forth in glory there

																					Looked eastward from the farms
																					And twice each day the flowing sea
																					Took Boston in its arms
																					The men of yore were stout and poor
																					And sailed for bread to every shore
																					
And where they went on trade intent
																					They did what freeman can
																					Their dauntless ways did all men praise
																					The merchant was a man
																					The world was made for honest trade
																					To plant and eat be none afraid
																					
The waves that rocked them on the deep

Old Europe groans with palaces

																					We plant and build by foaming seas
																					A city of the poor
																					For day by day could Boston Bay
																					Their honest labor overpay
																					
We grant no dukedoms to the few
																					We hold like rights and shall
																					Equal on Sunday in the pew
																					On Monday in the mall
																					For what avail the plough or sail
																					Or land or life if freedom fail
																					
The noble craftsmen we promote
																					Disown the knave and fool
																					Each honest man shall have his vote
																					Each child shall have his school
																					A union then of honest men

																					Where now on heated pavements worn
																					The feet of millions stride

																					And where the western hills declined
																					The prairie stretched away
																					
What care though rival cities soar
																					Along the stormy coast
																					Penns town New York and Baltimore
																					If Boston knew the most
																					
They laughed to know the world so wide
																					The mountains said Goodday
																					We greet you well you Saxon men
																					Up with your towns and stay
																					The world was made for honest trade
																					To plant and eat be none afraid
																					
For you they said no barriers be
																					For you no sluggard rest
																					Each street leads downward to the sea

O happy town beside the sea
																					Whose roads lead everywhere to all
																					Than thine no deeper moat can be
																					No stouter fence no steeper wall
																					
Bad news from George on the English throne
																					You are thriving well said he
																					Now by these presents be it known
																					You shall pay us a tax on tea
																					Tis very smallno load at all
																					Honor enough that we send the call
																					
Not so said Boston good my lord
																					We pay your governors here
																					Abundant for their bed and board
																					Six thousand pounds a year
																					Your highness knows our homely word
																					Millions for selfgovernment
																					But for tribute never a cent
																					
The cargo came and who could blame
																					If Indians seized the tea
																					And chest by chest let down the same
																					Into the laughing sea
																					For what avail the plough or sail
																					Or land or life if freedom fail
																				
																					
The townsmen braved the English king
																					Found friendship in the French
																					And Honor joined the patriot ring
																					Low on their wooden bench
																					
O bounteous seas that never fail
																					O day remembered yet
																					O happy port that spied the sail
																					Which wafted Lafayette
																					Polestar of light in Europes night
																					That never faltered from the right
																					
Kings shook with fear old empires crave
																					The secret force to find
																					Which fired the little State to save
																					The rights of all mankind
																					
But right is might through all the world
																					Province to province faithful clung
																					Through good and ill the warbolt hurled
																					Till Freedom cheered and the joybells rung
																					
The sea returning day by day
																					Restores the worldwide mart
																					So let each dweller on the Bay
																					Fold Boston in his heart
																					Till these echoes be choked with snows
																					Or over the town blue ocean flows

I will be your own and glad
																					Lovers would be fools to care
																					How a thing is good or bad
																					When the sky is everywhere
																					
I will be your own she said
																					Because your voice is like the rain
																					And your kiss is wine and bread
																					Better than my fathers grain
																					
So I took her where she spoke
																					Breasts of snow and burning mouth
																					Crying cranes and drifting smoke
																					And the blackbirds wheeling south

575,JOHN MAYNARD,Horatio Alger (1832-1899),1832,Narrative Poems,"WAS on Lake Eries broad expanse
																					One bright midsummer day
																					The gallant steamer Ocean Queen
																					Swept proudly on her way
																					Bright faces clustered on the deck
																					Or leaning oer the side
																					Watched carelessly the feathery foam
																					That flecked the rippling tide
																					
Ah who beneath that cloudless sky
																					That smiling bends serene
																					Could dream that danger awful vast
																					Impended oer the scene
																					Could dream that ere an hour had sped
																					That frame of sturdy oak
																					Would sink beneath the lakes blue waves
																					Blackened with fire and smoke
																					
A seaman sought the captains side
																					A moment whispered low
																					The captains swarthy face grew pale
																					He hurried down below
																					Alas too late Though quick and sharp
																					And clear his orders came
																					No human efforts could avail
																					To quench the insidious flame
																					
The bad news quickly reached the deck
																					It sped from lip to lip
																					And ghastly Faces everywhere
																					Looked from the doomed ship
																					Is there no hopeno chance of life
																					A hundred lips implore
																					But one the captain made reply
																					To run the ship on shore
																					
A sailor whose heroic soul
																					That hour should yet reveal
																					By name John Maynard easternborn
																					Stood calmly at the wheel
																					Head her southeast the captain shouts
																					Above the smothered roar 
																					Head her southeast without delay
																					Make for the nearest shore
																					
No terror pales the helmsmans cheek
																					Or clouds his dauntless eye
																					As in a sailors measured tone
																					His voice responds Ay ay
																					Three hundred souls the steamers freight
																					Crowd forward wild with fear
																					While at the stern the dreaded flames
																					Above the deck appear
																					
John Maynard watched the nearing flames
																					But still with steady hand
																					He grasped the wheel and steadfastly
																					He steered the ship to land
																					John Maynard can you still hold out
																					He heard the captain cry
																					A voice from out the stifling smoke
																					Faintly responds Ay ay
																					
But half a mile a hundred hands
																					Stretch eagerly to shore
																					But half a mile That distance sped
																					Peril shall all be oer
																					But half a mile Yet stay the flames
																					No longer slowly creep
																					But gather round that helmsman bold
																					With fierce impetuous sweep
																					
John Maynard with an anxious voice
																					The captain cries once more
																					Stand by the wheel five minutes yet
																					And we shall reach the shore
																					Through flame and smoke that dauntless heart
																					Responded firmly still
																					Unawed though face to face with death
																					With Gods good help I will
																					
The flames approach with giant strides
																					They scorch his hand and brow
																					One arm disabled seeks his side
																					Ah he is conquered now
																					But no his teeth are firmly set
																					He crushes down his pain
																					His knee upon the stanchion pressed
																					He guides the ship again
																					
One moment yet one moment yet
																					Brave heart thy task is oer
																					The pebbles grate beneath the keel
																					The steamer touches shore
																					Three hundred grateful voice rise
																					In praise to God that he
																					Hath saved them from the fearful fire
																					And from the engulphing sea
																					
But where is he that helmsman bold
																					The captain saw him reel
																					His nerveless hands released their task
																					He sank beside the wheel
																					The wave received his lifeless corpse
																					Blackened with smoke and fire
																					God rest him Never hero had
																					A nobler funeral pyre

Twelve months ago that wonderful night
																					You gave your life to me in a kiss
																					Have I done well for that past delight
																					In return to have given you this
																					
Look down at his face your face beloved
																					His eyes are azure as yours are blue
																					In every line of his form is proved
																					How well I loved you and only you
																					
I felt the secret hope at my heart
																					Turn suddenly to the living joy
																					And knew that your life in mine had part
																					As golden grains in a brass alloy
																					
And learning thus that your child was mine
																					Thrilled by the sense of its stirring life
																					I held myself as a sacred shrine
																					Afar from pleasure and pain and strife
																					
That all unworthy I might not be
																					Of that you had deigned to cause to dwell
																					Hidden away in the heart of me
																					As white pearls hide in a dusky shell
																					
Do you remember when first you laid
																					Your lips on mine that enchanted night
																					My eyes were timid my lips afraid
																					You seemed so slender and strangely white
																					
I always trembled the moments flew
																					Swiftly to dawn that took you away
																					But this is a small and lovely you
																					Content to rest in my arms all day
																					
Oh since you have sought me Lord for this
																					And given your only child to me
																					My life devoted to yours and his
																					Whilst I am living will always be
																					
And after death through the long To Be
																					Which I think must surely keep loves laws
																					I should you chance to have need of me
																					Am ever and always only yours

1896,TO A LADY WHO SPOKE SLIGHTINGLY OF POETS,Washington Allston (1779-1843),1779,Poems on Poetry,"H censure not the Poets art
																					Nor think it chills the feeling heart
																					To love the gentle Muses
																					Can that which in a stone or flower
																					As if by transmigrating power
																					His genrous soul infuses
																					
Can that for social joys impair
																					The heart that like the libral air
																					All Natures self embraces
																					That in the cold Norwegian main
																					Or mid the tropic hurricane
																					Her varied beauty traces
																					
That in her meanest work can find
																					A fitness and a grace combind
																					In blest harmonious union
																					That even with the cricket holds
																					As if by sympathy of souls
																					Mysterious communion
																					
Can that with sordid selfishness
																					His wideexpanded heart impress
																					Whose consciousness is loving
																					Who giving life to all he spies
																					His joyous being multiplies
																					In youthfulness improving
																					
Oh Lady then fair queen of Earth
																					Thou loveliest of mortal birth
																					Spurn not thy truest lover
																					Nor censure him whose keener sense
																					Can feel thy magic influence
																					Where nought the world discover
																					
Whose eye on that bewitching face
																					Can every source unnumberd trace
																					Of germinating blisses
																					See Sylphids oer thy forehead weave
																					The lilyfibred film and leave
																					It fixd with honied kisses
																					
While some within thy liquid eyes
																					Like minnows of a thousand dies
																					Through lucid waters glancing
																					In busy motion to and fro
																					The gems of diamondbeetles sow
																					Their lustre thus enhancing
																					
Here some their little vases filld
																					With blushes for thy cheek distilld
																					From roses newly blowing
																					Each tiny thirsting pore supply
																					And some in quick succession by
																					The down of peaches strewing
																					
There others who from hanging bell
																					Of cowslip caught the dew that fell
																					While yet the day was breaking
																					And oer thy pouting lips diffuse
																					The tincturestill its glowing hues
																					Of purple morn partaking
																					
Here some that in the petals prest
																					Of humid honeysuckles rest
																					From nightly fog defended
																					Flutter their fragrant wings between
																					Like hummingbirds that scarce are seen
																					They seem with air so blended
																					
While some in equal clusters knit
																					On either side in circles flit
																					Like bees in April swarming
																					Their tiny weight each other lend
																					And force the yielding cheek to bend
																					Thy laughing dimples forming
																					
Nor Lady think the Poets eye
																					Can only outward charms espy

2100,THE BATTLE OF BLENHEIM,Robert Southey (1774-1843),1774,Poems on War,"T was a summer evening
																					Old Kaspars work was done
																					And he before his cottage door
																					Was sitting in the sun
																					And by him sported on the green
																					His little grandchild Wilhelmine
																					
She saw her brother Peterkin
																					Roll something large and round
																					Which he beside the rivulet
																					In playing there had found
																					He came to ask what he had found
																					That was so large and smooth and round
																					
Old Kaspar took it from the boy
																					Who stood expectant by
																					And then the old man shook his head
																					And with a natural sigh
																					Tis some poor fellows skull said he
																					Who fell in the great victory
																					
I find them in the garden
																					For theres many here about
																					And often when I go to plough
																					The ploughshare turns them out
																					For many thousand men said he
																					Were slain in that great victory
																					
Now tell us what twas all about
																					Young Peterkin he cries
																					And little Wilhelmine looks up
																					With wonderwaiting eyes
																					Now tell us all about the war
																					And what they fought each other for
																					
It was the English Kaspar cried
																					Who put the French to rout
																					But what they fought each other for
																					I could not well make out
																					But everybody said quoth he
																					That twas a famous victory
																					
My father lived at Blenheim then
																					Yon little stream hard by
																					They burnt his dwelling to the ground
																					And he was forced to fly
																					So with his wife and child he fled
																					Nor had he where to rest his head
																					
With fire and sword the country round
																					Was wasted far and wide
																					And many a childing mother then
																					And newborn baby died
																					But things like that you know must be
																					At every famous victory
																					
They said it was a shocking sight
																					After the field was won
																					For many thousand bodies here
																					Lay rotting in the sun
																					But things like that you know must be
																					After a famous victory
																					
Great praise the Duke of Marlbro won
																					And our good Prince Eugene
																					Why twas a very wicked thing
																					Said little Wilhelmine
																					Nay  nay  my little girl quoth he
																					It was a famous victory
																					
And everybody praised the Duke
																					Who this great fight did win
																					But what good came of it at last
																					Quoth little Peterkin
																					Why that I cannot tell said he
																					But twas a famous victory

2101,BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,Thomas Campbell (1777-1844),1777,Poems on War,"F Nelson and the north
																					Sing the glorious days renown
																					When to battle fierce came forth
																					All the might of Denmarks crown
																					And her arms along the deep proudly shone
																					By each gun the lighted brand
																					In a bold determined hand
																					And the prince of all the land
																					Led them on
																					
Like leviathans afloat
																					Lay their bulwarks on the brine
																					While the sign of battle flew
																					On the lofty British line
																					It was ten of April morn by the chime
																					As they drifted on their path
																					There was silence deep as death
																					And the boldest held his breath
																					For a time
																					
But the might of England flushed
																					To anticipate the scene
																					And her van the fleeter rushed
																					Oer the deadly space between
																					Hearts of oak our captain cried when each gun
																					From its adamantine lips
																					Spread a deathshade round the ships
																					Like the hurricane eclipse
																					Of the sun
																					
Again again again
																					And the havoc did not slack
																					Till a feeble cheer the Dane
																					To our cheering sent us back
																					Their shots along the deep slowly boom
																					Then ceased  and all is wail
																					As they strike the shattered sail
																					Or in conflagration pale
																					Light the gloom
																					
Out spoke the victor then
																					As he hailed them oer the wave
																					Ye are brothers ye are men
																					And we conquer but to save
																					So peace instead of death let us bring
																					But yield proud foe thy fleet
																					With the crews at Englands feet
																					And make submission meet
																					To our king
																					
Then Denmark blessed our chief
																					That he gave her wounds repose
																					And the sounds of joy and grief
																					From her people wildly rose
																					As death withdrew his shades from the day
																					While the sun looked smiling bright
																					Oer a wide and woeful sight
																					Where the fires of funeral light
																					Died away
																					
Now joy old England raise
																					For the tidings of thy might
																					By the festal cities blaze
																					Whilst the winecup shines in light
																					And yet amidst that joy and uproar
																					Let us think of them that sleep
																					Full many a fathom deep
																					By the wild and stormy steep
																					Elsinore
																					
Brave hearts to Britains pride
																					Once so faithful and so true
																					On the deck of fame that died
																					With the gallant good Riou 
																					Soft sigh the winds of heaven oer their grave
																					While the billow mournful rolls
																					And the mermaids song condoles
																					Singing glory to the souls
																					Of the brave

2102,BATTLE OF FONTENOY,Bartholomew Dowling (1823-1863),1823,Poems on War,"Y our campfires rose a murmur
																					At the dawning of the day
																					And the tread of many footsteps
																					Spoke the advent of the fray
																					And as we took our places
																					Few and stern were our words
																					While some were tightening horsegirths
																					And some were girding swords
																					
The trumpetblast has sounded
																					Our footmen to array
																					The willing steed has bounded
																					Impatient for the fray
																					The green flag is unfolded
																					While rose the cry of joy
																					Heaven speed dear Irelands banner
																					Today at Fontenoy
																					
We looked upon that banner
																					And the memory arose
																					Of our homes and perishd kindred
																					Where the Lee or Shannon flows
																					We lookd upon that banner
																					And we swore to God on high
																					To smite today the Saxons might
																					To conquer or to die
																					
Loud swells the charging trumpet
																					Tis a voice from our own land
																					God of battles  God of vengeance
																					Guide today the patriots brand
																					There are stains to wash away
																					There are memories to destroy
																					In the best blood of the Briton
																					Today at Fontenoy
																					
Plunge deep the fiery rowels
																					In a thousand reeking flanks
																					Down chivalry of Ireland
																					Down on the British ranks
																					Now shall their serried columns
																					Beneath our sabres reel
																					Through the ranks then with the warhorse
																					Through their bosoms with the steel
																					
With one shout for good King Louis
																					And the fair land of the vine
																					Like the wrathful Alpine tempest
																					We swept upon their line
																					Then rang along the battlefield
																					Triumphant our hurrah
																					And we smote them down still cheering
																					Erin shanthagal go bragh

As prized as is the blessing
																					From an aged fathers lip
																					As welcome as the haven
																					To the tempestdriven ship
																					As dear as to the lover
																					The smile of gentle maid
																					Is this day of longsought vengeance
																					To the swords of the Brigade
																					
See their shatterd forces flying
																					A broken routed line
																					See England what brave laurels
																					For your brow today we twine
																					Oh thrice blessd the hour that witnessd
																					The Briton turn to flee
																					From the chivalry of Erin
																					And Frances fleur de lis
																					
As we lay beside our campfires
																					When the sun had passd away
																					And thought upon our brethren
																					Who had perished in the fray
																					We prayed to God to grant us
																					And then wed die with joy
																					One day upon our own dear land
																					Like this of Fontenoy
